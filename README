This repository contains a collection of scripts to manipulate third-party EDA
libraries and make them compatible with Verilator.  The Verilog-Perl library
is necessary for at least some of the scripts:

TODO
* Regression tests to run the scripts
* Regression tests to verify the functionality of the modified libraries
* Support for different third-party library versions
